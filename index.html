     <h2>Why choose InstruMe? </h2>


     <p> You began playing an instrument when you were younger but had to stop once you moved away from your parent's house and couldn't bring your instrument with you? Indeed some instruments like the cello and piano are quite heavy to carry and take up a lot of space which we do not always have when we move in a smaller apartment in a bigger city. 
      With a membership with InstruMe you have the possibility to rent a room with our partners univeristies & music schools that provide you an instrument and offer you a place to practice your instrument in a quite environment. IntruMe offers a delivery service as well where you can rent an instrument for several hours/days that will be delivered directly to your home. Moreover, it helps you connect with musicians sharing the same passion in groups where volunteers offer their house as a place where you can go and practice your instrument for several hours a week. </p>
